A new release of GruntLauncher is available on [VisualStudioGallery](http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/dcbc5325-79ef-4b72-960e-0a51ee33a0ff) for you to download.

This new release brings a lot of improvements: 

 - better gruntfile parsing support
 - use of a submenu to group all grunt commands, useful when your gruntfile has many entries ( thanks to Mads Kristensen who did all the work 
 - support for executing bower update on all your packages or on a specific package when right-clicking on it ( again thanks to Mads Kristensen )
 - support for gulpfile parsing in the same way it is done with gruntfiles (I've began to use gulp and support for it was easy to add )
