I own a kindle touch. Before that I had a kindle keyboard which got replaced instantly after a fall that broke the screen. 

In the past three years I've used it extensively and sang its praises to anyone willing to listen: it's light, it holds thousands of book, almost evverything is available as ebook and the electornic version is cheaper.

I even convinced a couple of people I know to buy one and they were satisfied too. Making it short I loved the Kindle.

Last week I was browsing Amazon to order a copy of Thinking with type by Ellen Lupton and while browsing I saw that it was available in kindle form. Due to the price difference and the fact that I would not have to wait for delivery I decided to order that. 

One click later I had bought it and I was downloading it to my Kindle. Six minutes later it was still downloading and here I started to suspect something was amiss as a normal ebook weighs 1MB more or less. This, I discovered later, was a whopping 116MB ebook.

After the download I tried to open it discovering that essentially it was not an ebook but a series of images depicting the pages. Imagine...essentially a pdf with no search capability on a 6 inch screen and without the possibility to rotate the screen which sometimes help you in reading pdfs.

I was a little deluded but thought " Eh the author wanted the book to keep the typographic arrangement and images as designed ... that I can understand" but at least I should have been warned that I could not read it on the Kindle as some books do.

Well to solve the problem I tried to download it on my computer but Kindle for windows 8 refused saying that the book was not available. This seems to appear quite frequently with the windows 8 version and on amazon forums it's often suggested to install thw windows 7 version. 

So off I go to download the old version but even that refuses to download the book as It says the book is not available. Here I was starting to get angry ... I bought the book ... saw that it was not fit to be used on a kindle due to the screen size but denied from usage on a computer which had a screen better suited to it. Long story short the only way I could read the book was using a tablet and the kindle App but susing a backlit screen for reading really strains the eye.

After these problems I ordered the successot to thinking with type and the same thing happened: a book made of images , readable only on a tablet....

I must say that I loved my kindle but after this problems I'm a little more wary in singing its praises. I mean, composing an ebook out of images I can understand, but let a user buy and download a book that he cannot read without a warning and preventing him to use it on the device he sees more fit is a little strange.
