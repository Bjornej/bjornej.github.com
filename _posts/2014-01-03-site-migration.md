As you've noted this blog had a redesign due to the migration from Octopress to plain Jekyll. I've had the idea to do this based on Phil Haack's [article](http://haacked.com/archive/2013/12/02/dr-jekyll-and-mr-haack/) and a little ( a lot  ) help from his and Zach Holman [repository](https://github.com/holman/left) and I must admit it was a success.

What are the pros of Jekyll against Octopress? Well :
- you can post from a browser with prose.io without needing to build the site on your computer
- the site is easier to understand and modify

The fact that you don't need a local installation and everything can be done from the browser is relly powerful, especially considering that you can setup prose.io to edit yout posts metadata exactly as you wish ( look at the config.yml file in this blog repository if you want an example ).

There are also some cons but I believe they are minor in respect to the pros but to be honest I'll list them

- Github pages doesn't allow plugins as it compiles the site with the ---safe switch but this is not usually a problem
- some features like category pages and tags pages are missing but thy could be built

All considered I consider this as a success and having the possibility to work from the browser should incite me to blog a little more.
